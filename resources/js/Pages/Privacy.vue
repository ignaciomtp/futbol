	  					<p>
	  					Welcome to Footble, a football-themed puzzle game. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our website, footble.io (#) ("Site"). We are committed to protecting your privacy and complying with applicable data protection laws, including the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), UK GDPR, and US privacy laws (e.g., California Consumer Privacy Act, CCPA).
	  					</p>

	  					<h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
	  					<p class="boldfont">No Personal Data Collection by Footble</p>
						<p>Footble does not collect, store, or process personal data (e.g., names, email addresses) directly from users. Our game operates without requiring user accounts or personal information.
						</p>

						<p class="boldfont">Local Storage</p>
						<p>To provide a seamless experience, Footble uses browser-based technologies (e.g., local storage) to save game progress, such as scores or preferences, directly on your device. This data is not transmitted to us or shared with third parties.
	  					</p>

	  					<p class="boldfont">Analytics</p>
	  					<p>We use Google Analytics to understand how users interact with our Site. This may collect anonymized data, such as:</p>
	  					<ul>
	  						<li>Device and browser information (e.g., type, operating system).</li>
	  						<li>Usage data (e.g., pages visited, time spent on the Site).</li>
	  						<li>Approximate location (e.g., country-level, based on anonymized IP addresses).</li>
	  					</ul>

	  					<p>Google Analytics uses cookies or similar technologies. We configure it to anonymize IP addresses to minimize personal data processing.</p>

	  					<p class="boldfont">Advertising</p>
	  					<p>We may display ads via third-party providers, such as Google AdSense. These providers may use cookies or similar technologies to serve personalized ads based on your browsing behavior or interests. This may involve:</p>
	  					<ul>
	  						<li>Tracking your interactions with ads.</li>
	  						<li>Collecting device identifiers or anonymized data to tailor ads.</li>
	  					</ul>


	  					<h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
	  					<p>We use the limited data described above to:</p>
	  					<ul>
	  						<li>Enable core game functionality (via local storage).</li>
	  						<li>Improve our Site’s performance and user experience (via analytics).</li>
	  						<li>Deliver relevant advertisements (via ad providers).</li>
	  					</ul>

	  					<h2>3. Legal Basis for Processing (EU/UK Users)</h2>
	  					<p>For users in the EU and UK, our legal bases under GDPR/UK GDPR are:</p>
	  					<ul>
	  						<li><strong>Legitimate Interests:</strong> For analytics and local storage to improve and operate the Site, where this does not override your rights.</li>
	  						<li><strong>Consent:</strong> For non-essential cookies (e.g., personalized ads), which you provide by continuing to use the Site or via your browser settings.</li>
	  					</ul>

	  					<h2>4. Sharing Your Information</h2>
	  					<p>We do not sell or share personal data. However, anonymized or aggregated data may be shared with:</p>
	  					<ul>
	  						<li><strong>Google Analytics:</strong> To analyze Site usage (see Google’s <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>).</li>
	  						<li><strong>Ad Providers:</strong> To serve ads (e.g., Google AdSense; see their <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>).</li>
	  					</ul>


	  					<h2>5. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
	  					<p>You have control over your data:</p>
	  					<ul>
	  						<li><strong>Browser Settings:</strong> Disable cookies or local storage via your browser to opt out of analytics or personalized ads (note: this may affect game functionality).</li>
	  						<li><strong>Do Not Track:</strong> We respect "Do Not Track" signals where supported by third-party providers.</li>
	  						<li><strong>EU/UK Rights (GDPR/UK GDPR):</strong> If any personal data is processed, you may have rights to access, rectify, erase, restrict, or port it, or object to processing. Contact us at [insert contact email].</li>
	  						<li><strong>US Rights (e.g., CCPA):</strong> You can opt out of targeted ads via browser settings. We do not sell personal data.</li>
	  					</ul>

	  					<h2>6. Third-Party Links</h2>
	  					<p>Our Site may contain links to third-party websites (e.g., ad networks). We are not responsible for their privacy practices. Please review their policies.</p>

	  					<h2>7. Data Security</h2>
	  					<p>We take reasonable measures to protect our Site, but no method is 100% secure. Local storage remains on your device and is not transmitted to us.</p>

	  					<h2>8. International Data Transfers</h2>
	  					<p>As Footble operates globally, third-party services (e.g., Google) may process data outside the EU/UK/US. We rely on their compliance mechanisms (e.g., Standard Contractual Clauses) to ensure adequate protection.</p>

	  					<h2>9. Children’s Privacy</h2>
	  					<p>Footble is not intended for users under 13 (or 16 in the EU/UK). We do not knowingly collect data from children. If you believe we have such data, contact us at [admin@footble.io].</p>

	  					<h2>10. Changes to This Policy</h2>
	  					<p>We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices or legal requirements. We will notify you of significant changes via the Site.</p>
